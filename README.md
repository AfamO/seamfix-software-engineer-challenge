# seamfix-software-engineer-challenge
A coding challenge and assessments 

The following assumptions are made:

#### That mongoDB is stored locally and running on port 27017, alternativeyl one can create an account on MongoDB Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database and then update the spring properties accordingly.

#### That there already exist pre-populated bvns atleast in the application, normally it should exists on the same application or an accessible remote server

#### A small web service has been implelemented and a little spring controller exposed just for the sake of consuming and having a web service to test against.

#### The question 3 are tested and have been asserted in test module under spring-boot test package of this application.

#### Question 2 are also tested under the same test package of the spring application.

#### A default spring port 8080 is used by deault both when running the spring boot application and when  running the unit/integration tests against the web service. Of course onc is free to change this inside spring application.properies file.
